[Description](https://linktodocumentation)
The current model of the Trin Financial Group uses widely available public research to refine our products and offer the ever-evolving consumer base. We then rely on our research and analysis teams to come up with solutions for problems that already exist. All the while we monitor the usage and behavior of our current client database but let all these datapoints to go to waste. We suggest that we incorporate Generative AI into our operations to analyze the behavior of our client database to retain and through them, encourage new customers by analyzing the effectiveness of our current products. With this information we can be proactive in providing offers and solutions to gauge what consumers like our own are already interested in and in turn finding what groups we do not cater to already, maybe interested in.
